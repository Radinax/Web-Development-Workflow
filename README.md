# Web Development Boilerplate for Websites

> Run your client and server with a single command

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run on the terminal the gulp command
gulp

```

## Folder Distribution

The workflow I currently for creating websites (that don't need heavy User Interactions) using SASS is as follows:

- src
    - images
    - js
        - main.js
    - sass    
        - styles.scss
    - index.html
- gulpfile.js

This is my personal boiler plate for developing websites that don't need a framework like React which would be an overkill for what needs to be done.

The gulpfile has some important tasks that makes your site more efficent and also comes with way to compile sass (*.scss) into css. The result is a build folder in the same root directory which is where the website will be.

## Closure

This is the Workflow I currently use, I find that its confortable to work with for any Application.
